# Monitoring, Logging, and Alerting Implementation Report

---

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the setup and configuration of end-to-end observability for the platform to ensure application reliability and proactive issue detection. The observability stack includes:

- **Prometheus** for metrics monitoring
- **Grafana** for visualization and alert management
- **Loki** for centralized logging
- **Tempo** for distributed tracing

The key focus areas include monitoring infrastructure components such as MySQL and NFS servers, application health, and alerting on critical conditions.

## 2. Monitoring Setup

### 2.1 Prometheus Installation

The Prometheus stack was deployed using the official Helm chart with customized scrape configurations to monitor MySQL and NFS exporters in addition to Kubernetes cluster components.

#### Helm Commands

```bash
# Add Helm repositories and update
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update

# Install Prometheus stack with custom configuration
helm install prometheus-stack prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \
  --namespace monitoring --create-namespace -f values.yaml

# Install Loki stack for centralized logging
helm install loki grafana/loki-stack --namespace monitoring

# Install Tempo for distributed tracing
helm install tempo grafana/tempo --namespace monitoring
